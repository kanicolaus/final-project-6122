<<< WHAT DO WORK ON >>>
- enumerated list that corresponds to the screen object type; this will determine what happens when we collide with it
	- when we collide - return the enumerated type 
- Randomize the generation of blocks on the screen and increase the number of them on screen as time increases
- Create a "power-up" object that modifies the "speed" at which the avatar moves
- 

KN:
- movement power up
